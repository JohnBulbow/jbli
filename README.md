John Bulbow Language Institute

Welcome to the John Bulbow Language Institute site page.

More courses are being added soon.

This site was built mostly with Bootstrap (a combo of HTML+CSS+JS Bundle). I had previously self-learnt all 3 languages years ago but I'm new to Bootstrap which made it super easy to build and manipulate to my needs.

My contact with Bootstrap was through Digital Innovation One (DIO) with course "Construindo p√°ginas para internet com Bootstrap" with Senior Python Developer Rafael Galleani (excellent teacher - please note: audio and video lectures in brazilian portuguese).
